# TCPGuard fh server example

This is a complete `github.com/oarkflow/fh` server wired to TCPGuard as an enterprise anomaly-detection and business-rule enforcement layer. It demonstrates global rules, endpoint rules, correlation rules, BCL-configurable detector modules, authz, HMAC/replay protection, datasource lookups, audit envelopes, approvals, incidents, metrics, and management APIs.

## Run

```bash
cd examples/tcpguard_fh_server
go mod tidy
go run .
```

Application server: `http://127.0.0.1:18184`

Management server: `http://127.0.0.1:18185`

Default management API key: `dev-management-key`. Override with `TCPGUARD_MGMT_API_KEY`.

## User-facing decision messages

TCPGuard renders safe, readable decision responses through `ResponseMessagePolicy`. This example intentionally also uses `WithResponseRenderer` so production APIs keep a stable, professional response envelope while still using the environment-aware public response builder internally. The FH adapter uses the same policy for metadata headers and `OnDecision` emits structured decision logs for every allowed, monitored, challenged, throttled, blocked, or denied request.

Environment behavior:

- `TCPGUARD_ENV=production` or unset: returns a clear user message, request ID, effect, severity, risk score, and safe categories only. Sensitive values, raw headers, tokens, signatures, nonces, body payloads, datasource values, and internal rule IDs are not exposed.
- `TCPGUARD_ENV=staging`: keeps production-safe values but may expose rule IDs for validation.
- `TCPGUARD_ENV=development` or `test`: returns full diagnostics for local debugging, including matched rule IDs and non-sensitive values. Sensitive fields such as authorization, cookie, token, secret, password, API key, signature, nonce, card, CVV, body, and payload are still redacted when detected.

Production denial body shape:

```json
{
  "code": "TCPGUARD_BLOCK_CRITICAL",
  "message": "Request blocked by security policy. Reason category: signature.",
  "description": "Reason category: signature. Contact support with the request_id if this legitimate request was blocked.",
  "effect": "block",
  "allowed": false,
  "status": 403,
  "severity": "critical",
  "risk_score": 100,
  "request_id": "req_...",
  "details": [
    {"type":"finding","id":"bad_signature","category":"signature","severity":"critical","risk":100}
  ]
}
```

Development denial body shape adds diagnostic fields such as `details[].message`, `details[].fields`, `matched_rules`, public evidence, and action errors where applicable.


## Response renderer and structured logs

This example keeps `WithResponseRenderer` enabled. The renderer does **not** expose raw TCPGuard internals directly. Instead, it wraps `tcpguard.PublicDecisionResponseRenderer(exampleResponsePolicy())` and adds stable API metadata such as `service` and `documentation`. That gives applications full control over their public error contract without leaking sensitive evidence.

The FH middleware also configures `OnDecision: logHTTPDecision`. Every decision is written as a structured JSON log entry using `tcpguard.DecisionLogEntry(...)`. Production logs are intentionally more detailed than production responses: they include rule IDs, finding categories, evidence categories, actions, policy version, config hash, trace data, and audit envelope IDs. Raw sensitive values remain redacted or hashed in production logs. Development/test logs may include more diagnostic values to speed up local debugging.

Production user response goal: minimal, understandable, supportable.

Production operator log goal: detailed, searchable, safe for SIEM/SOC debugging.

Example production response fields:

```json
{
  "code": "TCPGUARD_BLOCK_CRITICAL",
  "message": "Request blocked by security policy. Reason category: signature.",
  "description": "Reason category: signature. Contact support with the request_id if this legitimate request was blocked.",
  "request_id": "req_...",
  "service": "tcpguard",
  "documentation": "See X-TCPGuard-Trace/request_id in application logs for operator diagnostics."
}
```

Example production log fields include:

```json
{
  "event": "tcpguard.http.decision",
  "effect": "block",
  "allowed": false,
  "severity": "critical",
  "risk_score": 100,
  "matched_rules": ["signed-transfer-required"],
  "findings": [{"id":"bad_signature","type":"signature","field_keys":["signature","timestamp"]}],
  "request": {"id":"req_...","method":"POST","path":"/api/v1/transfers","header_keys":["X-TCPGuard-Signature"]},
  "network": {"ip_hash":"..."},
  "identity": {"id_hash":"..."}
}
```

## Curl scenarios

### 1. Clean public request

Purpose: proves the FH adapter lets low-risk traffic pass and still adds TCPGuard metadata headers.

```bash
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:18184/public
```

Expected response:

- Status: `200 OK`
- Headers: `X-TCPGuard-Risk: 0`, `X-TCPGuard-Decision: allow`, `X-TCPGuard-Message: Request allowed.`, possibly `X-TCPGuard-Trace`
- Body shape:

```json
{"ok":true,"message":"clean request allowed","risk":""}
```

Response description: TCPGuard evaluated the request, found no abuse/business/security signal, and FH continued to the route handler.

### 2. Debug/probe query throttled by endpoint rule

Purpose: demonstrates DSL detector/rule handling for suspicious query parameters.

```bash
curl -i 'http://127.0.0.1:18184/public?debug=true'
```

Expected response:

- Status: usually `429 Too Many Requests` in enforce mode when `throttle` is selected
- Headers: `X-TCPGuard-Decision: throttle`, `X-TCPGuard-Risk` around `55`
- Body includes `code`, readable `message`, `description`, `effect`, `allowed`, `status`, `severity`, `risk_score`, `request_id`, and safe `details`

Response description: `debug-query-probe` / `debug_query_probe` identifies a probe-style query and applies the throttle response.


### 2b. Production-safe denial body vs development diagnostics

Purpose: shows the same blocked request rendered with safe production disclosure. Start the server with `TCPGUARD_ENV=production` or leave it unset.

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
  -H 'X-User-ID: banned-user' \
  http://127.0.0.1:18184/public
```

Expected response:

- Status: `403 Forbidden` or another enforced status depending on the selected effect
- Headers: `X-TCPGuard-Decision`, `X-TCPGuard-Risk`, `X-TCPGuard-Severity`, `X-TCPGuard-Trace`, `X-TCPGuard-Message`
- Body shape: `code`, `message`, `description`, `effect`, `allowed`, `status`, `severity`, `risk_score`, `request_id`, and safe `details`
- Production body does **not** expose raw tokens, signatures, cookies, authorization headers, body payloads, datasource values, or internal rule details. The application log for the same request contains the detailed structured decision with rule IDs, finding/evidence categories, action results, policy version, config hash, and hashed/redacted identifiers for debugging.

Response description: the user receives an understandable reason and a request ID for support, while sensitive security evidence remains in TCPGuard audit/incident records. Re-run with `TCPGUARD_ENV=development go run .` to include fuller local diagnostics.

### 3. Global per-IP rate rule after repeated requests

Purpose: verifies global rate counters and endpoint-independent abuse handling.

```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do curl -i -H 'X-Forwarded-For: 10.10.10.10' http://127.0.0.1:18184/public; done
```

Expected response:

- First few responses: `200 OK`
- Later responses: `429 Too Many Requests`
- Headers on throttled responses: `X-TCPGuard-Decision: throttle`, `X-TCPGuard-Severity: medium`
- Production body explains that the request rate limit was exceeded without exposing sensitive values; development body also references the `demo-rate-limit` rule

Response description: repeated requests from the same IP exceed the demo threshold and demonstrate global protection.

### 4. Credential stuffing / password spray

Purpose: sends explicit `auth.login_failed` events through the demo endpoint to trigger auth abuse rules.

```bash
for u in a b c d; do \
  curl -i -X POST \
    -H 'X-Forwarded-For: 203.0.113.25' \
    -H "X-User-ID: $u" \
    http://127.0.0.1:18184/_demo/auth/fail; \
done
```

Expected response:

- Early failures may be monitor/allow depending on counters
- Once thresholds are crossed: decision body has `code`, readable `message`, `effect: block`, `severity: critical`, high risk score, and `request_id`
- Production details include safe auth-abuse categories; development details include finding messages and matched rule IDs

Response description: TCPGuard tracks failed-auth velocity by IP/user and distinct users to detect credential-stuffing behavior.

### 5. Correlated account takeover chain

Purpose: demonstrates sequence/correlation detection: three failed logins followed by a successful login.

```bash
for i in 1 2 3; do \
  curl -s -X POST -H 'X-User-ID: user-1' -H 'X-Forwarded-For: 198.51.100.45' http://127.0.0.1:18184/_demo/auth/fail >/dev/null; \
done
curl -i -X POST -H 'X-User-ID: user-1' -H 'X-Forwarded-For: 198.51.100.45' http://127.0.0.1:18184/_demo/auth/success
```

Expected response:

- Status: challenge-style response, commonly `403` depending renderer/effect mapping
- Production body contains a readable challenge/block message and request ID; development body includes `matched_rules` containing `account-takeover-correlation-chain` and trace contributors
- Production application logs include the matched rule, trace contributors, findings, actions, and incident/approval references

Response description: the rule sequence matches an ATO chain and escalates to MFA/SOC notification/incident action.

### 6. Account takeover signals from a new device/country

Purpose: tests behavioral signal detection without an auth-failure sequence.

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
  -H 'X-User-ID: user-1' \
  -H 'X-New-Device: true' \
  -H 'X-Previous-Country: US' \
  -H 'X-Country: NP' \
  http://127.0.0.1:18184/api/v1/account/login
```

Expected response:

- Status: challenge-style response
- Headers: `X-TCPGuard-Decision: challenge`, `X-TCPGuard-Severity: high`
- Body includes `account-takeover-abuse` and finding `account_takeover_risk`

Response description: TCPGuard combines new device, country change, session drift, and profile risk into an ATO score.

### 7. Known banned user through memory datasource

Purpose: demonstrates business/security lookup against a memory datasource.

```bash
curl -i -H 'X-User-ID: banned-user' http://127.0.0.1:18184/public
```

Expected response:

- Status: `403 Forbidden`
- Headers: `X-TCPGuard-Decision: block`, `X-TCPGuard-Severity: critical`
- Production body shows a safe block reason and request ID; development body includes matched rule `cache-banned-user`. Production logs include the matched rule and sanitized datasource evidence.

  curl -i -X POST -H 'X-User-ID: analyst-1' http://127.0.0.1:18184/api/v1/reports/export; \
done
```

Expected response:

- Later responses contain elevated risk and export-abuse findings
- Depending threshold/action, decision may be challenge or throttle

Response description: repeated exports by the same entity are treated as possible data exfiltration.

### 13. Application attack probe

Purpose: checks path traversal / injection / SSRF-style abuse detection.

- Body includes matched rule `high-value-payment-after-hours`

Response description: the derived event `business.high_value_payment` fires and blocks high-value after-hours approval.

### 16. Dynamic route ownership check

Purpose: verifies path-parameter extraction and endpoint-level authorization/business ownership checks.

```bash
curl -i -X PUT \
  -H 'X-User-ID: user-1' \
  http://127.0.0.1:18184/api/users/user-2/order/order-9
```

Expected response:

- Status: challenge-style response
- Body includes rule `dynamic-order-change`
- Evidence shows route params, especially `request.params.id = user-2`

```

Expected response body:

```json
{"method":"POST","path":"/api/v1/transfers","signature":"<hex>","nonce":"nonce-...","timestamp":1760000000,"secret":"server-side only in real deployments"}
```

Response description: use `signature`, `nonce`, and `timestamp` with the exact same body in the next request.

### 19. Use the returned valid signature

Purpose: proves valid signed requests are allowed and replay-protected.

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-User-ID: manager-1' \
  -H 'X-TCPGuard-Signature: <signature>' \
  -H 'X-TCPGuard-Nonce: <nonce>' \

  --data '{"amount":100}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:18184/api/v1/transfers
```

Expected response:

- First use: `200 OK`, body `{"ok":true,"message":"signed transfer accepted",...}`
- Reusing the same nonce: `403 Forbidden` with finding `nonce_reused`

Response description: signature validation passes once; nonce reuse is blocked as replay.

### 20. Audit chain, incidents, and metrics

Purpose: confirms operational visibility after running scenarios above.

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18184/_demo/audit
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18184/_demo/incidents

```

Expected response:

- Audit: JSON object with `valid: true` and `envelopes`
- Incidents: JSON array of open incidents created by block/critical rules
- Metrics: JSON object with decision counts, detector counts, action counts, durations

Response description: audit envelopes are tamper-evident and metrics show enforcement activity.

### 21. Management API health and audit verification

Purpose: demonstrates secured management endpoints.

```bash
curl -i -H 'X-API-Key: dev-management-key' http://127.0.0.1:18185/health
curl -i -H 'X-API-Key: dev-management-key' http://127.0.0.1:18185/audit/verify
```

Expected response:

- Health: `200 OK` with `{"ok":true}`
- Audit verify: `200 OK` with `valid: true` unless audit data was tampered

Response description: management API requires the configured API key and provides operational control-plane checks.

### 22. Policy simulation/explanation through management API

Purpose: tests a request context without sending traffic through the application route.

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
  -H 'X-API-Key: dev-management-key' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"event":{"type":"request.received"},"context":{"request":{"id":"sim-1","method":"GET","path":"/public","headers":{"User-Agent":"sqlmap"}},"network":{"ip":"203.0.113.10"},"security":{},"rate":{},"extra":{}}}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:18185/explain
```

Expected response:

- Status: `200 OK`
- Body includes `effect`, `risk`, `matched`, `findings`, `evidence`, `audit_hash`, and `policy`

Response description: the management API explains why a synthetic request would be allowed, blocked, challenged, or throttled.

## CLI checks

Validate and lint the policy from the repository root:

```bash
go run ./cmd/tcpguard validate -dir ./examples/tcpguard_fh_server
go run ./cmd/tcpguard lint -dir ./examples/tcpguard_fh_server
go run ./cmd/tcpguard lint -strict -dir ./examples/tcpguard_fh_server
```

Expected response: JSON with policy validity and linter issues. Strict mode exits non-zero when warnings exist.

## Production notes

The demo uses an in-memory store for easy local execution. In production, use Redis or another shared store so abuse counters, nonce state, bans, audit state, approvals, incidents, entity profiles, and correlation windows are consistent across all application instances.

Use policy linting, simulation, audit verification, and staged reloads before deploying rule changes to production.
